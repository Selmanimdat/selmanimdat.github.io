    <p><b>NLP CLASSIFICATION & SENTIMENT ANALYSIS</b></p>
    <p>Our sentiment analysis project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze restaurant reviews, providing valuable insights for users. By processing text data from customer reviews, our model identifies sentiment polarity, distinguishing between positive and negative feedback. Through rigorous data preprocessing and model training, we ensure accurate predictions, enabling users to gauge the overall sentiment of each review effortlessly. With a focus on user experience and data integrity, our project delivers reliable insights into restaurant experiences, empowering users to make informed decisions and enhancing their dining journey.</p>

    <p><b>Image Classification with CNN for CIFAR_10</b></p>
    <p>This project implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The project begins by loading the dataset and preprocessing the data to scale pixel values between 0 and 1. A CNN model is then constructed using sequential layers, including convolutional and max-pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers with ReLU activation. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. After training for 20 epochs, the model achieves an accuracy of around 68% on the test set. Lastly, the trained model is saved for future use. This project provides a solid foundation for building image classification systems and understanding CNN architectures.</p>

    <p><b>Car or Bike Classification Computer Vision</b></p>
    <p>I developed a computer vision model for classifying images as either cars or bikes using TensorFlow and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The dataset consisted of images of cars and bikes, which were preprocessed by resizing them to a uniform size. After splitting the data into training and validation sets, I built a CNN model with three convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, flattening, and dense layers for classification. The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 93.37% on the validation set after training for 10 epochs. Finally, I saved the trained model for future use. This project was inspired by Zafer Acar's notes and resources from OpenAI's chat platform.</p>
